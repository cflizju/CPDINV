Cwt
- Read grid data and do continuous wavelet transform using 'FAN wavelet' ,then radial power spectrum at each grid point
in dw band

.SH SYNOPSIS
Cwt infile wavenumber voice distance outfile

.SH DESCRIPTION
Cwt reads grid data from MinCurV,then do continuous wavelet transform(Cwt) using a new, hybrid wavelet-the 'FAN wavelet',which is described in Kirby and Swain, 2004.
wavelets at different azimuths and scales are convolved with the entire magnetic anomaly grid, avoiding the segmentation of the signal into ﬁnite‐size windows. 
The wavelet transform offers a better compromise between spatial and wavenumber resolution than moving windows since the wavelet transform uses a combination of multiple wavelet
scales to construct a power spectrum at each grid point.
